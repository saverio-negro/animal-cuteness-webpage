# Animals Cuteness Webpage

<h2>What's the Purpose of such a Webpage?</h2>

<p>The idea first came out of my feelings for my beloved one, my Cassy.</p>

<p>I thought I'd resemble the gist of cuteness that she conveys to me via cute animals.</p>

<p>After all, we all love animals, right? </p>

<p>Finally, the purpose is also to spread out a word of sensitivity towards our environment, and the fact that we are part of a unique ethical framework, which includes our lands, and therefore, other species. As such, we should treat our land as our fellow members of our community, and keep in mind that us humans are susceptible to natural laws.</p>
