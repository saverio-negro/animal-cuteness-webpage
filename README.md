<h3>What's the Purpose of such a Webpage?</h3>

<p>The idea first came out as an inspiration being born to my feelings for my beloved one, my Cassy.</p>

<p>I thought I'd resemble the gist of cuteness that she conveys to me via cute animals.</p>

<p>After all, we all love animals, right? </p>

<h3>Environmental Ethic</h3>

<p>Finally, the purpose is also to spread out a word of sensitivity towards our environment, and the fact that we are part of a unique ethical framework, which includes our lands, and therefore, other species. As such, we should treat every living being - coming from the land and the land itself - as our fellow members of our community, and keep in mind that us humans are susceptible to natural laws.</p>
